🌟 What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UI) — especially for dynamic, interactive websites.

Instead of manually updating the DOM like in plain JS, React:

Breaks UI into components

Uses state to manage changing data

Automatically updates the screen when data changes

Think of it as a smarter way to build modern web apps.

🧠 Core Concepts

Components → Reusable UI blocks

State → Data that changes

Props → Data passed between components

JSX → HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript

🚀 Where React is Used

Dashboards

📚 How to Study Efficiently

Learn concept → Build small project

Don’t only watch tutorials

Practice by debugging errors

Build 5–6 real projects

<!-- react commands--------------> -->

to create a react project normal method ----> npx create-react-app project_name

to create a project using vite(vite is a bundler and is comparatively faster to build project as vite only installs necessary files )---> npm create vite@latest

h+enter for help

how to run scripts? -->  npm rum script_name

agar node_modules package nahi hai project ke andar so ---> npm i (i is for install and ab jo bhi necessary files hongi sari install hongi ab)
